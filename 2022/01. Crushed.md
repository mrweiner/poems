Crushed
-------

I've always been one to leave
my books unblemished, thinking 
that their pristine margins 
imbued them with some particular glory

but I just grabbed my copy of 
The Philosopher's Club
and noticed that its top edge
was crushed near the spine

and far from paralyzed
it now has its own story
freed from the words of a poet 
whom it has never met
