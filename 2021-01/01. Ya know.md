Ya know

I didn't much care for all the fur
that dripped deliberately from you as though you were the faucet
in the bathroom of a century-old house; the fur you cast about
like Catty Appleseed in the throes of a grand plan to lay claim
to the couch and the bed and everything in between and
become the fatcat mogul of a cider empire
brewed from your fairly frazzled fluff. 

Then again,
given your penchant for ingestional bathing I suppose 
you probably didn't much care for the twenty-one inch 
curly brown strands that slink from my scalp like leaves 
after autumn, given that you might jet from your litterbox
like hellfire fleeing God's freezer, evidently spooked 
by the stray poop you'd left in your wake that I'd 
unwittingly hung from your chimney with care.

Considering a choice between 
lint rollers and skittish business 
...
I suppose I got the better end of the deal.
