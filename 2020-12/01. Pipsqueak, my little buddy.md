Pipsqueak, my little buddy
--------------------------

No longer in the window, 
no longer on the couch.
No longer waking up 
with squeaky mews to let you out.
No pitter pats to greet me
from the sidewalk 'front the house
nor trusting gazes, sapphire,
to melt my down-and-outs.

A mat of white on my duvet,
a shadow of your dreams,
accompanies my weary eyes
as they sequester streams.
I love you, Pip, my munchkin friend,
through darkness you were light.
Pandemic; wildfire smoke...
you always shone so bright.
