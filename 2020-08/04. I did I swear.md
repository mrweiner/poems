I did, I swear
--------------

I'm fairly certain
that I used to exist 
before the plague;

that I used to exist
outside of my house...
well, not my house but

the house owned by the elderly man 
on the other side of the wall
who coughs loudly and often, 

and watches VHS pornography loudly, 
and often mounts a response  
to his tsunami of postage

just before it heaves itself
onto the concrete slab
that his grandfather laid

before the municipal building
lived across the street and
before central air, 

and back when my south-facing, 
single-pane bedroom windows
framed the whinnies of horses

not the brays of sunrise 
rennovations or the clinks
of meth-cooking moontinkerers.

I'm fairly certain 
that I used to exist
outside of my house 

but I know that that existence
has cast itself amongst the stars
as past lives tend to do.

I'm sure that I will exist again
...but it will be different
...and that makes me sad.
