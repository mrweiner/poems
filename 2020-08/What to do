what to do when what you know
turns into what you knew,
when people and distraction part
and all that's left is you,

when improv gigs with grown up kids
are what you used to do,
their states of flow, like passing tones,
were only passing through.

proximity the post-it notes
your plans are strewn about,
perhaps it's time to break the rhyme;
to breathe, and venture out.
