When I look upon photos
of steel clouds marbled white
I paste myself below them.
Why wouldn't I?

I've seen plenty of candied sheets 
of light peacocking toward earth, 
professsing of God to hills 
more concerned with rolling

but I know those photographed clouds
like the back of somebody else's hand 
and I mistake our acquaintence 
for friendship.

When I took a photo, though, 
of steel clouds marbled white
by a shuttered New Mexico sun, 
I raised myself a sandstone bridge

up past the treeline toward high desert;
toward the peace of a backpacking boy 
who'd never walked so far 
or witnessed such beauty.
