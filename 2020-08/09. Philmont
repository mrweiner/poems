When I look upon photos
of steel clouds marbled white
I paste myself below them.
Why wouldn't I?

I've seen my own candied sheets 
of light peacocking toward earth, 
professsing of God to hills concerned
more with their own rollings

but in reality I know the clouds 
in those photos like the back 
of somebody else's hand and I mistake 
our acquaintence for friendship.

When I took a photo, though, 
of steel clouds marbled white
by a shuttered New Mexico sun, 
I raised myself a sandstone bridge

to the high desert as it was
in the eyes of a backpacking boy 
who'd never walked so far 
or seen anything so beautiful.
