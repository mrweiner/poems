Why bother doing when you could instead
decide to do nothing at all?

Resort to observing the tic-tic-toc worming
of moments that poof into past.

To dawdle sans splendor and bask in the boredom
of dreams that continue to cast

the snow into spring and the showers to summer 
and sweltering sun into fall.
