Why bother
----------

Why bother doing when you could instead
decide to do nothing at all?
Resort to observing the tic-tic-toc worming
of moments that poof into past.

To dawdle sans splendor and bask in the boredom
of dreams that continue to cast
the snow into spring, the showers to summer,
the sweating resignment to fall.
