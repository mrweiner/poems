A state aflame
--------------

Inspiration is in the air and it smells
like 624 wildfires ravaging my home state,
consuming over 1.2 million acres 
of what little normalcy we've left,

smoke constructing cul de sacs of thoroughfares, 
turning a lively white AC filter to a mournful gray 
every 36 hours; I didn't realize I could be 
more confined than I already was.

Inspiration sounds like my talkative siamese cat 
who doesn't understand why he still cannot 
fucking go outside and catch dragonflies
and then complain that he wants back inside;

feels like being unable to self-medicate
10,800-strikes-of-dry-lightning anxiety
because I need to be sober enough to evacuate 
myself and my animals; like flashbacks to videos

of friends barreling through hellfire to escape
Paradise in 2018; to a flame-topped ridge
before evacuating Scripps Ranch in 2003;
to all the ash I've seen between.
