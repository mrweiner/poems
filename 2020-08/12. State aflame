A state aflame
--------------

Inspiration is in the air and it smells
like 624 wildfires ravaging my home state,
consuming over 1 million acres 
of what little normalcy we've left; 

smoke constructing cul de sacs of thoroughfares, 
turning another of my snow white AC filters  
a mournful gray every 24 hours; I didn't realize
I could be more confined than I already was.

It sounds like my cross-eyed siamese cat 
who doesn't understand why he still cannot 
fucking go outside and catch dragonflies
and complain that he wants back inside.

It feels like being unable to self-medicate
10,800-strikes-of-dry-lightning anxiety
because I need to be sober enough to evacuate 
at a moments notice; like flashbacks to videos

of friends barrelling through hellfire to escape
Paradise in 2018, and of a flame-topped ridge
before evacuating Scripps Ranch in 2003, 
and of all the ash I've seen between.
