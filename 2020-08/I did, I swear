I used to exist
outside of my house.
Well, not my house but

the house owned by the elderly man 
on the other side of the wall, 
who coughs loudly and often 

and watches VHS pornography loudly, 
and often forgets
that he needs to collect his mail 

before its overstuffed
blue, rusted abode is topped
by a bright, pink reminder

that he's supposed to go outside 
once every 72 hours; the house
his grandfather built

before the municpal building
lived across the street and
before central air and back when

my painted-shut, south-facing, 
single-pane bedroom windows
framed the whinnies of horses

instead of the sunrise renovations
who champ at the bit of the eviction 
of meth-cooking moontinkerers.

I used to exist
outside of my house
before the virus painted me in.
