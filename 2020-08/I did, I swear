I used to exist
outside of my house.
Well, not my house but

the house owned by the elderly man 
on the other side of the wall, 
who coughs

loudly and often and watches
VHS pornography loudly, 
and often forgets

that he needs to collect
his mail before the overstuffed
blue, rusted envelope is topped

by a bright, pink reminder
that he's supposed to go outside 
once every 72 hours. The house

his grandfather built
before the municpal building
lived across the street;

when my drafty, south-facing, 
single-pane bedroom windows
framed whinnying horses, not

the every-morning renovations
that follow the eviction of
meth-cooking cranksters.

I used to exist
outside of my house.
Before the virus.
