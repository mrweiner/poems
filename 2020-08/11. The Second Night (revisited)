The Second Night (2017)
-----------------------

The trouble with pillows
is that they lack the motivation
to pull themselves closer
in an act of affection.

Sliding my hand beneath a pillowcase
doesn't raise hairs on my pillow's neck,
or quicken its heart rate, or provide 
the relief of meandering fingertips.

All it does is make me feel silly
because here I am crying into a pillow
and I can't fix my sheets 
because my hand is stuck in a dream.
