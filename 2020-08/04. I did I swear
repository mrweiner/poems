I did, I swear
--------------

I'm fairly certain
that I used to exist 
before the virus.

I used to exist
outside of my house...
well, not my house but

the house owned by the elderly man 
on the other side of the wall
who coughs loudly and often, 

and watches VHS pornography loudly, 
and often forgets to mount a response  
to his tsunami of postage

before the coral notice is rested
atop it, a gentle reminder that
one must weather the storm

between the bedroom and the porch
at least once every 72 hours; 
the porch his grandfather built

before the municipal building
lived across the street and
before central air, 

and back when my south-facing, 
single-pane bedroom windows
framed the whinnies of horses

not the braying of rennovations, 
champed at the bit of the eviction of  
the meth-cooking moontinkerer.
