I did, I swear
--------------

I used to exist
outside of my house.
Well, not my house but

the house owned by the elderly man 
on the other side of the wall
who coughs loudly and often, 

and watches VHS pornography loudly, 
and often forgets to respond 
to his veritable tsunami of postage

before the seaweed-pasted wreckage
is topped by a bright, pink reminder
that he needs to weather the storm

between his bedroom and the porch
at least once every 72 hours; 
the porch his grandfather built

before the municipal building
lived across the street and
before central air and back when

my painted-shut, south-facing, 
single-pane bedroom windows
framed the whinnies of horses

not the braying of sunrise rennovations 
who champed at the bit of the eviction 
of that meth-cooking moontinkerer.

I used to exist
outside of my house
before the virus painted me in.
