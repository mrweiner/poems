My guitar amp hums,
but not in the way that one might hum 
a tune from their childhood
or the melody of their wife's favorite song.

My guitar amp hums
not like a man without obligations
hums to the sun
but like a man without purpose
hums through life.

Its monotonous buzz,
unending and unaware,
carries on with a complete 
lack of regard for my desires.

"I'm trying to record over here," 
I remind it lovingly -- yet firmly --
making sure to keep my cool,
because while I don't care for its smugness
I know that it will always be there for me
no matter what.
