My guitar amp hums,
but not in the way that one might hum 
the melody of their wife's favorite song.

My guitar amp hums not
like a man without worry but 
like a man without purpose.

Its monotonous buzz carries 
on without care for my
labored contemplation.

"I'm trying to record over here," 
I remind it with strict love
making sure to keep my cool.

I don't much care for its smugness,
but I know that if I treat it well
it will always be there for me

No matter what.
