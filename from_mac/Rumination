is like fleas. You know,
the ones that set up camp 
after your roommate adopts a tabby cat 
from below your kitchen window,

its fur fohawked in bunches
like it's tried to clean itself again 
but still hasn't figured out how.

Rumination, like the fleas,
begins as an invisibly pregnant worry
but gives birth to an army of annoyance; 
a slow barrage of concerns, 

each one leaping to safety
just as it's been spotted,
only to be hastily replaced 

by doppelgangers more motivated 
to drain you of confidence 
one consequence at a time.
As they bleed your control

do your best to recall
that unlike the armored assailants 
imported by that trojan cat,

their extermination doesn't require
a fog of fumigated pet store poison --
only   
                                          a breath.
