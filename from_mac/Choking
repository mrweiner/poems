tonight I lay bare
in the middle of my mattress,
pushing away memories

of the three nights 
I slept on the right
and she on the left

and I again had to contend
with a cramped arm beneath my side,
a difficulty that I readily welcomed

after years of not worrying about
somebody stealing my sheets
or about losing out on sleep

because a becautiful woman 
had to leave my house 
but wouldn't leave my thoughts

my forehead rested against the blues and oranges 
of the eye-ball filled fractal suns and sky
that were tattooed on her shoulder

much in the same way that
humid summer air rests against the grass,
and I had to reposition my head

because the lack of air between us
made it hard for me to breathe
but easier for me to feel at ease 

and I smiled as she swelled against me 
ever so slightly with every breath 
but now I smile less

and I wish that tonight 
I felt the weight of her breath
instead of the weight of my memories.





so vibrantly that I wasn't sure
whether the tattoo itself was brightening my mood,
or just her

like it still would in

and harder still to consider
that these
