Leaves slosh
under two pair
of feet, bare.

Fresh mud squeezes its way
between recently scrubbed toes,
presenting pleasantly
familiar feelings 
toward skin accustomed 
only to soap and cotton.

Diamonds descend
from the trees above,
signaling their presence
with silent splashes.
The only evidence
of their existence
a light mist left
on otherwise forgotten
arm hairs.

Breaths of laughter linger 
in the cool woody air
leaving a trail of 
moments passed --
left but not forgotten.
