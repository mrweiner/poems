Trees do tease as winters freeze,
While white winds whip away
Remaining rugged limbs and leaves,
That thought they'd surely stay.

Bark brings lovers clad in wool,
Minds seeking silly marks,
Silver slivers cutting cool
Initials into parks.

Children chasing just for sport,
Delve deep into white woods,
One cold mistake cuts play short.
