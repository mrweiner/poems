The trouble with pillows
is that they lack the motivation
to pull themselves closer
in an act of affection.

The warmth they provide is nothing but interest 
compounded on heat I've invested into air pockets 
strewn throughout a mess of mangled down
that lack the slowing swells of sleepy breaths.

Sliding my hand beneath a pillowcase
doesn't raise hairs on my pillow's neck,
or quicken its heart rate, or provide the relief 
of fingertips grazing over skin.

All it does is make me feel silly
because here I am crying into a pillow
and I can't fix my sheets
because my hand is stuck in a dream.
