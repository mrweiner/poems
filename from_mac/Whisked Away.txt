A short little boy walked right into my shop,
Grasping only a toy and a green lollipop.
His ginger hair rustled, his glasses askew,
He'd been in a tussle, I figured I knew.

He shuffled right by me, went straight to the back
To grab something shiny -- a little nicknack.
Concealing the trinket he turned to go home,
Passed by, like a bandit, my countertop throne.

His eyes toward his feet, he moved straight for the door,
But our eyes they did meet before he left the store.
I ruined his fun when I asked with a sting,
Excuse me please, son, can you pay for that thing?

He stood, for a moment, admired its glean,
Made sure its components were spotlessly clean.
With wonder and caring he checked its condition
Was worthy of sharing with those in his kitchen.

The item he risked was no more than a tool,
Aluminum whisk with which one might mix gruel.
Why would the boy take this, a silly utensil,
And act so remiss when his heist lacked potential?

I asked of the boy why he's tempted to steal
Instead of a toy, something which mixes meals.
His head hung quite heavy, as though it held boulders,
Surrendered already and shrugging his shoulders.

He did not like taking but could not afford it,
He wanted to bake things so that's why he floored it.
He knew it was wrong but Mom's birthday was near,
No gift from her son could cause mom's eyes to tear.

I felt my heart melt like ice sculptures in summer,
This cute little tyke just wants something for mother.
I told him to leave and take one whisk for free,
To roll up his sleeves and not say its from me.

He burst out the door with a grin on his face,
Was off to explore at a quickening pace,
Gave the whisk to mom upon arriving home,
Their smiles mixed cakes, on his countertop throne.
