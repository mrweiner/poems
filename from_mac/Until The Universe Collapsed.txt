Like a ten ton mist
Your words settle in my chest.

"In all respects
You're perfect,
But...
I don't know."

No longer whole,
Past simplicities swallow me.

Of mac, cheese, 'n' crispy hot dogs
Seasoned only with our scowls 
Toward judgmental smoke detectors.

Of conversations on time and space,
Broken intermittently by laughter
Over streaming sitcoms.
Your intrigued parakeet
Fluffed on my shoulder.

With the eagerness of a glacier,
I lift my pillow from your bed.
What I wouldn't give to jump away 
From your icy 
Feet 
One final time.

Memories fill my motions,
Walking tears over trembling lips.

Wandering along daffodils and
Under those trees with the 
Giant pink flowers 
You love so much.
Stopping to greet 
Each smiling cat we meet.

Long expected,
Your next six years would arrive
In accepting envelopes.
Your smirking eyes would
Proudly proclaim the news.
And we would embrace.

With joy-veiled melancholy
I'd hold you 
Until the universe collapsed.

Just as a painter basks in
Picking the perfect hue,
Lovers learn the full benefits
Of taking in the minutia of 
One-another.

Friends, unfortunately,
Do Not.

Now grasping only fantasies,
My arms still anticipate
The sweet vanilla 
Perfume you wore
When it all
Began.

Your smiles now perch 
My grating hopes --
To again warm your fingertips
Below a cool spring moon --
Whispered away by distance and 
Potential futures.

We have been miles apart before. 
Hundreds of miles.
For a time.
Many times.
But this time is different.

Now embracing only my own
So-called comforter,
One serving left on the stove,
I will awake happily to your
Imperfections 
No longer.

I lov--

Take care.
