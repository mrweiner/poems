Sorry, I'm busy.
Sunday through Wednesday
we do not exist. 
Except in the warehouse.
Our evenings are preoccupied 
by the preparation of creation,
sights of regularly-timed meals
and Tuesday discount movies
replaced by aerial dancing 
and projections of cohort silhouettes 
waltzing across Abbey Road. 
A trumpet's arrival cues
dancers and tuning notes
scales and stretches
backbends and bullshitting.
The ego of a five-foot-wide 
rising sun headpiece
rings alongside talk 
of inter-tune transitions,
nervous bubbles of excitement 
over near-perfect routines
(and those that still need some love)
bring our cave to a boil.
To those unfamiliar 
with such utter nonsense
our collection of creative characters 
must appear uncontrollable, 
it's wrangling requiring
one with the wisdom of 
one thousand day care teachers.
Luckily, such a person exists:
our magician, or stage manager,
who knows the secret word 
capable of bringing 
such a beast to its knees.
