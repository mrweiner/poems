I dry my eyes incessently
like I imagine a sandstorm might -- 
my tears' triggers each a shard of sand

whipped to life by love's whirlwind,
drawing water from a brook that had forgotten
how to babble and wicking it away 

just as readily. My cries 
well inkblots into blankets -- 
DIY rorschach tests more ambiguous 

than those wielded by bushy-moustached 
white coats. At least those ones are given
meanings by patients seeking solace.

Us artists aren't allowed to contemplate 
the meanings of our own works
after placing them onto paper.
