Six-year-old girls shouldn't
need to place their sadness
between their toes 
and the heavy intent of a hammer

shaping dead contemplation
brought blue hot by bourbon breathes. 
Their little digits
lack the temper of anvils

and while the blacksmith 
celebrates his sweat 
upon hissing iron into oil,
muffled cries do little 

to quench the misery of a girl 
so brittle of thought,
so troubled of mind, 
so constructed of confusion.
