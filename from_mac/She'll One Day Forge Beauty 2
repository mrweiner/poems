Six-year-old girls shouldn't
need to place their sadness
between their toes 
and the heavy intent of a hammer

shaping dead contemplation
brought blue hot by bourbon breathes
and limited understanding. Their little digits
lack the temper of anvils

and while the blacksmith 
celebrates his sweat 
upon hissing iron into oil,
muffled cries do little 

to quench 
the misery 
    of a girl
    so troubled 
        of mind 
        so brittle
            of thought
            constructed 
                of confusion
