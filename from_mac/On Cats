I'm mad,
or at least I'm
headed that direction,
no longer at the helm of my
own thoughts.

Before,
loneliness sat
beside me unquestioned.
My ever-present companion.
But now

I smile.
I feel new warmth
missing from my bed, its tenant
dreaming sweet nothings from afar
and still

slipping
so gracefully
through my thoughts -- like a cat
between plants in a windowsill
garden.

Bated,
I welcome her,
as I know what it's like
when you're used to petting a cat
but can't.
