It doesn't do one well 
to fall in love with
a heartbroken woman

who teaches through tears and
mends through meditation and
whispers through withdrawal;

who wishes she were deaf
and wants nothing more 
than to adpot a deaf child

while your hands are trained
to navigate strings
but not signs;

whose outlandish stories
of pain and perserverance
prove she's stronger 

than you will ever be;
has more capacity to forgive 
than you will ever have.

It doesn't do one well 
to fall in love with
a heartbroken woman.

But who can help it?
