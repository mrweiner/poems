It doesn't do one well 
to fall in love 
with a heartbroken woman

who teaches through tears
connects through meditation
and recovers through withdrawal;

who wishes she was deaf
and wants nothing more 
than to adpot a deaf child

when your hands are trained
to navigate instruments
but not signs;

whose outlandish stories
of pain and perserverance
prove she's stronger 

than you will ever be
and has more capacity to forgive 
than you will ever have.

It doesn't do one well 
to fall in love 
with a heartbroken woman.

But who can help it?
