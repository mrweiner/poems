Roasted beets beat toasted cheese though broasted chicken's fine,
I tend to talk of cooking like a taster talks of wine.
I have a very cultured tongue that's more refined than yours,
the next time you eat artichokes you'd better pair with ports.

My pallette, unconventional, confuses most I know,
I take them down the rabbit hole -- but how far does it go?
You dice potatoes, mix with NATO, fry 'em up, but not too greasy,
let 'em cook for 15 years and BOOM you've got a tasty treaty.

Ever wonder how the politicians like to lunch?
They've never really told me but I've got a seasoned hunch.
They ask all their constituents what they would like to eat
then fly back home to Washington and laugh -- that's all they need.

The president's a carrot with a face I'd like to sear,
I'd plate him with his lies aside a glass of homebrewed beer.
You might not like the flavor but I promise it's divine,
he's got the best, no, greatest taste that you will ever find.
