Fascism? This again? Flags are in, citizen,
yours are right there between Finley and Finnigan,
fold them up, faster, for children and women, men,
help us ensure that the U.S. will win again.

You do want our country to prosper, correct?
You want to keep all of your freedoms intact?
You like having money and like to expect that
you're worth more than others whose thoughts you reject?

Then listen up, now, I'll not say it once more,
you've got to speak faster to even the score,
don't think before arguments, march out your door,
go level the field 'tween our rich and their poor.

The terror is brown and the job thiefs are yellow,
your wives can hang out but they'd better stay mellow,
the black ones do drugs so we pen them in ghettos,
don't venture there, you're all respectable fellows.

Be careful with news because as you're aware
so much of it's lies that are crafted to scare,
that's why we're preparing our our state-sponsored air
at which you can smile, nod, cheer, stomp or stare.

Your unions are dated, they squabble unneeded,   
our corporate shepards will lead you to eden
and baptize with gold all your trickle down defects,
diseases we wish weren't left so untreated.

So, Facism, citizen? That claim's a fad,
the fact that you think that we're headed there's sad,
forget that you thought it, its loss ironclad, 
get back to your place over there folding flags.
