Like a ten ton mist
your words settle in my chest.

"In all respects
you're perfect,
but...
I don't know."

No longer whole,
I yearn for what we had.

What I had.

I long for the simple things:
mac 'n' cheese 'n' burnt hot dogs 
seasoned by the smoked detector;
running from my apartment to yours, 
beaming, just to steal those  
extra seconds with you.
Catching my breath
I compose my smile
before knocking.

You never knew,
did you?

With the eagerness of a glacier,
I lift my pillow from your bed.
What I wouldn't give 
to jump away from 
your ice-cold feet 
one last time.

Everything I do reminds me of joy,
swells my throat,
and sends tears from my eyes.

Long-anticipated circumstances
pull us apart.
Your pre-destined six year future
has finally arrived,
sealed in an envelope of acceptance.
Congratulations!

We knew the day would come.
That, with the light of the sun 
beaming from your eyes,
you'd tell me the news 
through your smile
and we would embrace.

With joy-veiled melancholy,
I'd hold you 
until the universe collapsed.

In that moment, we'd never be apart.

But, every morning I hoped
that this infinite embrace would wait 
until tomorrow to arrive.

Though no longer lovers,
I still cannot wait 
to see your cold blue eyes.
To hear your voice.
To smell the perfume you wore
when it all
began.

But I know that from this inevitable joy,
will follow empty hope.
Hope for something that will not be.
At least for now.
Probably for ever.

We have been 
hundreds of miles removed before. 
For a time.
Many times.
But this time is different.
This time is for good.

I'll continue to wake.
But,
to your smile 
no longer.

I lov--

Take care.
