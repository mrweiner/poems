You can't afford diapers? 
I thought to myself,
knowing deep down

that this was no surprise.
I love you, my friend.
I love that you love

your job and wife
and daughter and music
and that you teach

people who cannot learn
from just anybody;
people whose enrichment

requires entusiasm;
people whose disabilities
uninvite disdain

from empty minds 
across crowded streets,
daily, you wear

your smile not as a mask
but as a blanket
large enough for all

whom you encounter.
I hope I don't forget
I'd like to cook you dinner.
