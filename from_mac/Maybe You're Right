Cliches are great when you can hurl them
across the street at your neighbor
or over a beer years later

after the sting has subsided
and the source of your suffering is nothing
but slant rhymes in missing journals

experiences that you pass on to your children
in the hopes that they will take your heartache
as a bypass around theirs, knowing they won't.

Maybe it is better to have loved and lost
than never to have had your heart travel
to another city, leaving your body behind 

like a snake after shedding;
maybe absence does make the heart grow fonder
in the same way that starvation seasons food;

maybe everything really does happen for a reason
and the reason is that reality is cold feet,
one glove, and a misplaced jacket with the tag still on.

Maybe all these flailing words are true,
but let's just let it hurt for now
and save them for a future drink or two.
